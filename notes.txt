Thanks for getting back to me!

So Contract1 a.k.a OriginalTimelockContract is the old contract from 2019, with over 1 million BSOV timelocked, and we aren't going to mess with that one.

We are working with Contract2 and RewardsReserve contract.

You can see on testnet.sovcube.com (Use Goerli Testnet through Metamask) how the user-interface is, but I can tell you the flow to make it easier to understand:
The user has a Regular Account and an Incoming Tokens Account. - When a user timelocks tokens, they are sent to regular account immediately. When a user claims a Timelock Reward, or if someone sends them Locked Tokens, they are sent to "Untaken Incoming Tokens", and a user has to "Accept Incoming Tokens" to receive tokens to the "Incoming Tokens Account".

Timelocking
1. User buys BSOV Token.
2. User Timelocks their BSOV tokens using the approveAndCall method in the BSOV contract and enters Contract2Address+Amount.
3. The approveAndCall function in BSOV contract then interacts with Contract2 through the receiveApproval function in Contract2.
_____________________________________
Timelock Rewards
4. The receiveApproval function then calls the updateEligibility function in the timelockRewardReserve contract (which is set by owner by calling setTimelockRewardReserveAddress)
5. updateEligibility function calculates the amount that the user should be rewarded according to the current tier, and then updates eligibleAmount a.k.a Unclaimed Timelock Rewards.

Claiming Rewards and Accepting Incoming Tokens
_______________________________________
6. The user has to "Claim Reward" to receive Unclaimed Timelock Rewards to "Untaken Incoming Tokens".
7. The user has to "Accept Incoming Tokens" to receive tokens into their "Incoming Tokens Account", where the lock time will reset to 1000 days.
_______________________________________
Yes,
0x26946ada5ecb57f3a1f91605050ce45c482c9eb1 is the correct address for BSOV on mainnet.

________________________________________
_totalSupply is max supply of 21 million (like bitcoin)
totalSupply is (max supply - burnt tokens)

________________________________________
Yes, BSOV burns 1% of each transaction without the ability for the owner to bypass or whitelist burn, like WHACKD.
